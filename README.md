# Aerodynamic Probe Calibration

This is a Master's project at the Univeristy of Cambridge in Turbomachinery.

## Description 

The code here was used to investigate repeatability and quantify errors for 3D printed multi-hole probes at miniature scales.
The aim was to adjust calibration maps by performing transformations for pitch, yaw and roll ofsets (transpositions and rotations). 
This was shown to reduce errors and a process was streamlined to minimise the impact of manufacturing defects.
The code investigates data for several probe design to draw conclusions on the calibration data sharing to streamline calibration time.
A Monte Carlo simulation is performed using a Gausian distribution for a sensitivity analysis and an uncertainty evaluation.
